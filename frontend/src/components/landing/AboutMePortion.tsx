                    Since my schooling days, I have developed a strong passion
                    for tech. As a result, I have self-learnt various
                    programming languages. This has exposed me to full-stack
                    development and the usage of cloud services as I have also
                    taken up various internships. Apart from my passion, my
                    hardwork and discipline has also helped in my development
                    journey.
